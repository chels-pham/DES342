                <p>Each time Prometheus molded animals, he handed out
                  Zeus's gifts. However, he realized that he had given
                  away all Zeus' gifts, and he had nothing left for his
                  brother to give to the human beings. When Prometheus
                  finished his work and saw his creatures shivering in
                  the cold, his heart ached. He could not bear the sight
                  of their suffering and wished to give his creations fire.<br><br>
                  Defying the gods, he steals fire and grants it to humanity.
                  He lifted his torch to the light of the sun, catching an
                  ember of fire.</p>

                <p>Zeus was furious that his order had been ignored. As punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock for many years. Every day an eagle swooped out of the sky and tore at Prometheus' liver, and every night his immortal liver once again grew.<br><br>
                  But that was not enough punishment for Zeus. Once Prometheus was chained to a rock, Zeus went after Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus. Zeus did not intent to chain Epimetheus to a rock. Zeus had a different kind of punishment in mind.</p>

                <p>Following the instructions of Zeusâ€”who wanted to punish Prometheus, Hephaestus modeled a beautiful woman out of clay. He then brought her to life and present her to Zeus. Zeus named his lovely new daughter Pandora. She was endowed with many god-given virtues and gifts, including curiosity, by all the other Olympian gods.<br><br>
                  Zeus sent her to Earth as a wife for Epimetheus. Despite warnings from his brother not to trust gifts from Zeus, Epimetheus accepted to marry her.

                <p>One day the god Mercury carried a magnificent box to the happy couple. Mercury wouldn't tell them what the box contained but only that it had to remain sealed forever. He asked the couple if he could leave the box with them, and they agreed.<br><br>
                  Pandora was very curious about the contents of the box, but she had promised Mercury she would never open it. However, she could not stop gazing at the box. She began to imagine that it contained beautiful gowns or exquisite jewelry, or even money!</p>
