      Epimetheus ran to her when he heard Pandoraâ€™s cry. 
      From the box, Pandora could still hear a voice 
      calling to her, pleading to be let out. 
      Epimetheus agreed that nothing inside the box 
      could be worse than the horrors that had already 
      been released, so they opened the lid once more.<br><br>
      All that remained in the box was Hope. It 
      fluttered from the box like a beautiful dragonfly, 
      touching the wounds created by the evil creatures, 
      and healing them.
