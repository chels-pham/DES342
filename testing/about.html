    <h1>About</h1><br>
    <p>
      When Prometheus stole fire from heaven, Zeus, the king of the gods,<br>
      took vengeance by presenting Pandora to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus.<br>
      Pandora opened a jar left in her care containing sickness, death and many<br>
      other unspecified evils which were then released into the world. Even though<br>
      Pandora had released pain and suffering upon the world, she had also allowed <br>Hope to follow them.
