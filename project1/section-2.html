                <p>Epimetheus molded animals, he handed out
                  Zeus's gifts. However, he realized that he had given
                  away <b>all</b> Zeus' gifts, and he had nothing left for his
                  brother to give to the human beings. When Prometheus
                  finished his work and saw his creatures shivering in
                  the cold, his heart ached. He could not bear the sight
                  of their suffering and wished to give his creations fire.<br><br>
                  <em>Defying the gods,</em> he steals <b>fire </b>and grants it to humanity.
                  He lifted his torch to the light of the sun, catching an
                  ember of fire.</p>

                <p>Zeus was <b>furious</b> that his order had been ignored. As punishment, Zeus chained Prometheus to a rock for many years. <em>Every day</em>, an eagle swooped out of the sky and tore at Prometheus' liver, and <em>every night</em>, his immortal liver once again <b>grew.</b><br><br>
                  But that was <em>not</em> enough punishment for Zeus. Once Prometheus was chained to a rock, Zeus went after Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus. Zeus did not intent to chain Epimetheus to a rock. Zeus had a <em>different</em> kind of punishment in mind.</p>

                  Zeus sent her to Earth as a wife for Epimetheus. <em>Despite warnings from his brother not to trust gifts from Zeus</em>, Epimetheus accepted to marry her.

                  Pandora was <em>very</em> curious about the contents of the box, but she had <b>promised</b> Mercury she would never open it. However, she could not stop gazing at the box. She began to imagine that it contained beautiful gowns or exquisite jewelry, or <em>even</em> money!</p>
