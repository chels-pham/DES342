      Each time Prometheus molded animals, he handed out<br>
      Zeus's gifts. However, he realized that he had given<br>
      away all Zeus' gifts, and he had nothing left for his<br>
      brother to give to the human beings. When Prometheus<br>
      finished his work and saw his creatures shivering in<br>
      the cold, his heart ached. He could not bear the sight<br>
      of their suffering and wished to give his creations fire.<br><br>
      Defying the gods, he steals fire and grants it to humanity.<br>
      He lifted his torch to the light of the sun, catching an<br>
      ember of fire.
